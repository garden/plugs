## Plans

  1. __Select__ this page's URL.
  2. **Link** it [here](https://thefiletree.com/demo/markdown.md).
     - Google what [recursion] means.
     - Go to `step 1`.

[recursion]: https://www.google.com/?q=recursion

This has gone on for long enough. It is time for a section break.

---

Let us now consider some recursive code, of complexity $`O(\infty)`:

```javascript
let recurse = () => {
  request('google.com/?q=recursion')
  .then(recurse)
}
```
